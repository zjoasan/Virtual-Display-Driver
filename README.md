# Virtual Display Driver
Based on Microsoft Indirect Display Driver Sample. This creates a virtual display in Windows that acts and functions just like a real one. It's useful for streaming, virtual reality applications, recording, headless servers, etc. The benefit over a physical display is the ability to adjust resolutions and refresh rates beyond the physical displays capabilities. For example, this would enable the ability to stream a game from your home PC using game streaming software at 240hz at 8K while owning a 60hz 1080p monitor (unrealistic, but explains the abilities well). For servers without displays, this enabled remote desktop and screen streaming to other systems as if there were a display installed. 

Supports emulating resolutions from **640 x 480** to **7680 x 4320 (8K)**, and refresh rates including **60hz, 75hz, 90hz, 120hz, 144hz, 165hz, 240hz, 480hz,** and **500hz.**

This project uses the official Windows Indirect Display Driver combined with the IddCx class extension driver.

## Easy Uninstall

1. Open device manager
2. Locate Display Adapters
3. Right click on IddSampleDriver, choose "Uninstall device"
4. There is a new popup window, in there click Attempt to remove driver for this device.

## Manual/Forced Uninstall

Next instructions are for those cases where the device is removed from the system, but driver stil remains. This happens when there is a connection to the device while trying to remove the drivers. To
remedy this, there is a a few tricks built into windows. So here goes:

1. Open up a powershell terminal and input this:
2.  ```pnputil /enum-drivers```
3. Locate iddsampledriver.inf, there might be multiple pages of text. Make a note of the "published name", it's often unique for your system, but might look like "oem139.inf"
4.  ```pnputil /delete-driver oem139.inf```
5.  (If you still get multiple displays after uninstall, try to repeat uninstall procedure in safemode.)

## HDR Support Now Available for Windows 11 22H2+
