This project creates a _virtual monitor_ in Windows that functions just like a physical display. It is particularly useful for applications such as **streaming, virtual reality, screen recording,** and **headless servers—systems** that operate without a physical display attached. 

Unlike traditional monitors, this virtual display supports custom resolutions and refresh rates beyond hardware limitations—offering greater flexibility for advanced setups. You can also use custom EDIDs to simulate or emulate existing hardware displays.

## ⬇️ Download Latest Version

- [Driver Installer (Windows 10/11)](https://github.com/VirtualDrivers/Virtual-Display-Driver/releases) - Check the [Releases](https://github.com/VirtualDrivers/Virtual-Display-Driver/releases) page for the latest version and release notes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before using the Virtual Display Driver, ensure the following dependencies are installed:
> - **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable**  
>   If you encounter the error `vcruntime140.dll not found`, download and install the latest version from the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170).


## 🛠️ Installation

- Step 1: Download the Virtual Driver Control app.
   - You can download the installer directly from the [Releases](https://github.com/VirtualDrivers/Virtual-Display-Driver/releases) page.

- Step 2: Extract to a folder and run the app
   - Launch the VDC.
   - Click the Install button.

- Step 3: Verify the Installation (Optional)
   - Check if the Virtual Display Driver is correctly installed by running the following:
   - **Device Manager:** Check "Device Manager" under "Display Adapters."
   - **Settings:** Check display settings under system settings and see if the virtual displays show.

While VDC is a good and friendly way to work with VDD, you can also do a a lot manually. Like adding or removing resolutions or enable/disable 
functions, which is done by editing vdd_settings.xml. You should be able to locate the file at the default location: 
```C:\VirtualDisplayDriver\vdd_settings.xml ```

For more information about manual installation, uninstallation and "personalization", please check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/VirtualDrivers/Virtual-Display-Driver/wiki) here on 
the project GitHub repository. If you are into tinkering, check out the Powershell scripts in [Community scripts](https://github.com/VirtualDrivers/Virtual-Display-Driver/tree/master/Community%20Scripts).
