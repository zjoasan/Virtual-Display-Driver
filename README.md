This project creates a _virtual monitor_ in Windows that functions just like a physical display. It is particularly useful for applications such as **streaming, virtual reality, screen recording,** and **headless servers‚Äîsystems** that operate without a physical display attached. 

Unlike traditional monitors, this virtual display supports custom resolutions and refresh rates beyond hardware limitations‚Äîoffering greater flexibility for advanced setups. You can also use custom EDIDs to simulate or emulate existing hardware displays.
